## Overview

This project combines Haar Cascade for face detection and a custom-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for mask classification. The model is trained to predict whether a person is wearing a mask or not in real-time.

## Features

- Real-time face detection
- Mask classification (with/without)
- Webcam integration
- Custom-trained CNN for mask detection
- Easy-to-use Python script
- User-friendly GUI to display live video feed with detection results

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow/Keras
- jupyter notebook

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the `DEEP_Learning_mask_detection_Avi_Project7.0-Copy1.ipynb` script.
